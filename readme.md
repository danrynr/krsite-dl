## FAQ
#### Q: Why is the download speed so slow?
A: The download speed is limited by the site itself. You can try to use a VPN to get a better speed.

#### Q: Can I set a default download path?
A: Yes, you can set a default download path by editing the config.ini file. The config.ini file is located in the same directory as the krsite-dl file. You can also set the default download path by using the -d option.

#### Q: Can I download images from multiple sites at once?
A: Yes, you can download images from multiple sites at once by using the -a option. The -a option takes in a text file containing site urls. Each line in the text file should contain a site url. You can also use the -ai option to download images from multiple sites at once (But this isn't working right now). The -ai option takes in a text file containing image urls. Each line in the text file should contain an image url.

#### Q: Can I download images from a site that is not listed above?
A: Yes, you probably can. You can also make an issue if you want to get a site supported.
